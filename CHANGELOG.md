## [2025-09-22] - Major Music System Improvements

### üéØ **Primary Objective**
Fix Discord music bot `/play` command timeout and DCA encoder EOF errors.

### ‚úÖ **Issues Resolved**

#### **1. Interaction Timeout Fixed**
- **Problem**: `/play` command was timing out after 3 seconds due to slow yt-dlp service startup
- **Solution**: Implemented deferred responses (`InteractionResponseDeferredChannelMessageWithSource`)
- **Result**: Commands now acknowledge immediately and respond when processing completes

#### **2. yt-dlp Environment Issues Fixed**
- **Problem**: Bot couldn't find yt-dlp in mise-managed Python environment
- **Solution**: Added `cmd.Env = os.Environ()` to preserve PATH in availability checks
- **Result**: yt-dlp service starts successfully and provides stream URLs

#### **3. DCA Encoder EOF Errors Reduced**
- **Problem**: Streaming failed with "EOF" errors and "exit status 8"
- **Solution**: Comprehensive DCA encoder improvements:
  - Enhanced FFmpeg options with built-in reconnection
  - Increased buffer size from 100 to 200 frames
  - Added frame-by-frame processing with error recovery
  - Implemented circuit breaker pattern (robust ‚Üí basic streaming fallback)
  - Stream validation before encoding
  - Voice connection retry logic
- **Result**: EOF errors eliminated, streaming completes successfully

#### **4. Logging System Overhauled**
- **Problem**: Excessive debug logging created noise and no file output
- **Solution**: Complete logging system rewrite:
  - File-based logging with daily rotation (`logs/bot-YYYY-MM-DD.log`)
  - Log level control via command line (`--log-level debug|info|warn|error`)
  - Reduced noise, kept essential operational information
  - Error/Warning to stderr, Info/Debug to file only
- **Result**: Clean console output, comprehensive file logs for debugging

#### **5. Dependencies Updated**
- **Problem**: Outdated discordgo library causing voice connection issues
- **Solution**: Updated to latest versions:
  - `discordgo v0.29.0`
  - `golang.org/x/crypto v0.42.0`
  - Other dependencies to latest compatible versions
- **Result**: Better voice connection reliability and feature support

### üõ†Ô∏è **Technical Improvements**

#### **Enhanced DCA Audio Player** (`music/player/player.go`)
- **Retry Logic**: Encoder creation with 3 attempts and exponential backoff
- **Stream Validation**: URL accessibility checks before encoding
- **Voice Connection Health**: Periodic validation during streaming
- **Error Recovery**: Specific handling for EOF, network, and timeout errors
- **Circuit Breaker**: Automatic fallback from robust to basic streaming
- **Frame Processing**: Individual frame error handling with consecutive error tracking

#### **Improved Voice Connection Management**
- **Health Monitoring**: OpusSend channel responsiveness testing
- **Retry Operations**: Voice operations with automatic retry logic
- **State Validation**: Guild/Channel ID verification for connection integrity
- **Speaking State**: Enhanced management with error recovery

#### **Service Integration Fixes**
- **Environment Handling**: Proper PATH preservation for mise Python environments
- **Service Startup**: yt-dlp service automatic management with health checking
- **HTTP Client**: Robust request handling with timeout and retry logic

### üìÅ **Files Modified**

#### **Core Application**
- `main.go` - Updated to use new logging system
- `go.mod/go.sum` - Dependency updates to latest versions

#### **Music System**
- `music/player/player.go` - **Major rewrite** with enhanced error recovery
- `music/manager/manager.go` - Integration with improved player
- `commands/music_play.go` - Fixed interaction timeouts with deferred responses

#### **Infrastructure**
- `utils/logger.go` - **New** comprehensive logging system
- `services/ytdlp/manager.go` - Fixed environment variable handling

#### **Documentation**
- `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` - **New** comprehensive issue tracking and analysis
- `CHANGELOG.md` - **New** detailed change documentation
- `README.md` - Updated with latest system status

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Remaining Issues**

#### **Music Playback Still Not Working**
While all infrastructure improvements are successful:
- ‚úÖ Bot connects to Discord and voice channels
- ‚úÖ yt-dlp provides valid stream URLs
- ‚úÖ DCA encoder creates without errors
- ‚úÖ Streaming completes without EOF errors
- ‚ùå **No actual audio output in Discord voice channels**

**Current Status**: Under investigation
**Likely Causes**: Voice permissions, audio format compatibility, or Discord transmission issues
**Next Steps**: Audio pipeline debugging, permission verification, alternative streaming approaches

### üìä **Testing Results**

#### **‚úÖ Successful Components**
- Command registration and slash command interaction
- yt-dlp service startup and YouTube metadata extraction
- Voice channel join/leave operations
- DCA encoder creation and streaming completion
- Error handling and user feedback
- Logging system with file output

#### **‚ùå Needs Investigation**
- Actual audio transmission to Discord voice channels
- Voice connection audio data flow
- DCA encoder output format compatibility

### üöÄ **Production Readiness**

#### **Infrastructure: Production Ready**
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery
- Automatic service management
- File-based logging with rotation
- Resource cleanup and memory management
- Docker support with multi-architecture images

#### **Music Playback: Requires Further Development**
- Core functionality works but audio output needs investigation
- All supporting systems operational
- Ready for audio pipeline debugging and fixes

### üìã **Next Development Cycle**

1. **Audio Pipeline Investigation**
   - Debug actual audio data transmission
   - Verify Discord voice permissions and settings
   - Test alternative audio streaming approaches

2. **Enhanced Debugging**
   - Add voice data transmission monitoring
   - Implement audio pipeline state logging
   - Create diagnostic commands for troubleshooting

3. **Alternative Solutions**
   - Evaluate different audio libraries if needed
   - Consider direct FFmpeg ‚Üí Discord streaming
   - Test with minimal audio configurations
